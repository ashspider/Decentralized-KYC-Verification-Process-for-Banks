# Decentralized-KYC-Verification-Process-for-Banks

Know your customer or KYC originated as a standard to fight against the laundering of illicit money flowing from terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking. The main process behind KYC is that government and enterprises need to track the customers for illegal and money laundering activities. Moreover, KYC also enables banks to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks and make better decisions.

# Need For KYC

Customer Admittance: This sector defines making anonymous accounts as restricted entry into the banking system. In other words, no anonymous accounts are allowed. Preliminary information, such as names, date of birth, addresses and contact numbers, is to be collected to provide banking service.

Customer Identification: In the case of suspicious banking transactions through a customer, customer accounts can be tracked and flagged. Further, they can be sent for processing under the bank head office for review.

Monitoring of Bank Activities: Suspicious and doubtful activities in any account can be zeroed in by the bank after understanding its customer base using KYC.

Risk Management: Now that the bank has all the preliminary information and the activity pattern, it can assess the risk and the likelihood of the customer being involved in illegal transactions.
